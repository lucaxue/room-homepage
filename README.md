- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

### Links

- Solution URL: [...](https://your-solution-url.com)

## Technology Used

![HTML](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML-2e2e2e?logo=html5)
![Tailwind CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tailwind%20CSS-2e2e2e?logo=tailwindcss)
![Vue JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vue%20JS-2e2e2e?logo=vue\.js)

I used the CDN for both Tailwind CSS and Vue JS, in order to get started as quickly as possible. I did not see the need to involve any build tools to the process, as this is just a small webpage to practice my skills.
