## Technology Used

![Tailwind CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tailwind%20CSS-2e2e2e?logo=tailwindcss)
![Vue JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vue%20JS-2e2e2e?logo=vue\.js)

I used the CDN for both [Tailwind CSS](https://beyondco.de/blog/tailwind-jit-compiler-via-cdn) and [Vue JS](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html#cdn), in order to get started as quickly as possible. I did not see the need to involve any build tools to the process, as this is just a small static webpage to practice my skills.

<div style='display:flex; align-items:bottom;'>
  This means that the whole project lives in just one simple HTML file.
